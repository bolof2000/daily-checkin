        "Broken Object Level Authorisation all starts with an object. Objects should be looked at in the context of \"Object Oriented Programming\", what I mean with that is objects are the things you think about first in designing a program and they are also the units of code that are eventually derived from the process. This can be anything, ranging from an account to an invoice to a credit note and everything in between. Usually these objects are marked with an identifier because we need to address these objects directly and this is where issue can arise because we need to always check if the user is allowed to access that object. This might seem simple at first but i can assure you it's not, more about that later in the \"testing\" section of this article.\n",

The more logic processing happens or data is returned, the more resources are taken up by a single call and this can stack on quick. If we do not rate limit our API endpoints. This issue is made even worse by the fact that most API's reside on shared hosts which means they are all fighting for the same resources which could mean the attacker is disabling a secondary unrelated API by consuming all the resources.\n",

Humans are predictable in nature and they tend to follow several patterns when it comes to hosting endpoints, for example it usually occurs that higher priviledge endpoints are hosted on the same relative path, which makes it easier for the users to guess these endpoints but that alone does not make the vulnerability though. We have to be able to access to endpoints as a lower priviledged users as well of course. This access can occur by executing the provided HTTP method (for example POST) but it can also occur on other methods that the developers left enabled (un)intentionally (for example DELETE).

To aid us we can ask ourself if this API even needs to be in production at all and who should have access to the API.

For a new feature to work, the target had to include certain libraries which were using outdated APIs but due to imperfect asset management, our target did not have an overview of these APIs existance. These endpoints ultimately led to more functionality being exposed which had an RCE in it.\n",
